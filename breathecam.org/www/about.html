            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              Carnegie Mellon's CREATE Lab is a community-focused technology empowerment and partnership organization.
              Our lab includes a diversity of skills, including technology development, research, education, and communications, among others.
              What everyone at CREATE has in common is philosophy of building relationships and partnerships with organizations and residents beyond the confines of our school's campus,
              and to serve those we work with to the best of our ability. With support from the Heinz Endowments, CREATE Lab has developed BreatheCams which are high-resolution,
              24-hour live camera feeds trained on industrial pollution sources in Pennsylvania.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are a member of the Breathe Collaborative, a coalition of communities, environmental advocates, public health professionals
              and academics working to improve air quality, eliminate climate pollution and make our region a healthy and prosperous place to live.
              Visit the <a href="https://breatheproject.org/" target="_blank">Breathe Project</a> to see the best available science and technology to better understand the quality of the air we breathe and opportunities to engage and take action.
