OpenCv version that I used is OpenCV 2.4.9.


* After making the file,Run the executalbe MaskedGaussian with the image and mask as argument
* Example "./MaskedGaussian Image.jpg Mask.jpg"
* The Resultant output will be saved in the directory as "inpaintedImage.jpg"
* Now has explicit 100% compression while imwrite. Should be lossless.
* I have disabled the option to show the image, so do "eog inpaintedImage.jpg" to view the output
